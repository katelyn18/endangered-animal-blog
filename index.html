            <h2>Canada Lynx</h2>
            <p>The Canada lynx (lynx canadensis) is a forest-dwelling cat with gray fur, similar to bobcats in size and appearance. Unlike bobcats, the lynx has large paws, long, black ear tufts, and a short, black tail. Their diet consists of the snowshoe hare, making their large paws and long hind legs ideal for hunting. Due to their prey, being in an area where there is a high population of snowshoe hare is best. As a result, the Canada lynx can be found in areas with moist, cool, boreal spruce-fir forests. However, the lynx also needs areas with deep, powdery snow. In addition to hunting snowshoe hare, the Canada lynx also hunts other small mammals, like red squirrels and birds. <br>

            <h2>California Condor</h2>
            <p>The California Condor (gymnogyps californianus) is the largest bird in North America and is listed as endangered. Adult condors have long, broad wings that end with “fingers” that are black with white patches under the wings. Their head is naked, usually yellow-orange or pink, and is bordered by a feather boa. <br>
                The California Condor can be found in California, Arizona, and Utah, where they nest in chaparral to forested mountain regions. They forage in open grasslands, which can be far from their nest. When foraging, they glide and soar, depending on the air movements and terrain that allows for long soaring flight. Due to how heavy they can weigh, takeoff can be a problem. As a result, they will often use open, windy areas so that they can run downhill or they launch themselves from a cliff or exposed branch. <br>
                Their diet consists of carrion mammals from land and sea (deer, cattle, sea lions, whales), and to get their calcium needs, they swallow bone chips and marine shells. The California Condor locate caracasses not by smell but by their eyesight, observing other scavengers assembled at a carcass. Typically, they will take the carcass from smaller species, but tolerate each other and feed in groups. <br>

            <h2>Arkansas Fatmucket</h2>
            <p>The Arkansas Fatmucket is a medium sized mussel of about 4 inches in length that is listed as threatened. With a smooth, shiny olive brown shell, female shells are rounded while male shells are pointed. Their diet consists of food particles (detritus, diatoms, plankton) filtered from water columns. The Fatmucket’s habitat range consists of the Ouachita, South Fork Ouachita, Saline, and Caddo Rivers in Arkansas. They prefer deep pools with sand, sand-gravel, sand-cobble, or sand-rock with sufficient water flow.  <br>

            <h2>Ocelot</h2>
            <p>The Ocelot (leopardus pardalis) is a medium-sized wildcat with a chain rosette spotted coat, a long ringed tail, and slightly rounded ears, and are listed as endangered. Their habitat ranges in the Western Hemisphere, from south Texas to northern Argentina. They can live in vegetated habitats (tropical/subtropical rainforests in Central/South America) to semi-arid thornscrub (Texas/northern Mexico). Ocelots use the dense vegetation for protection and hunting. <br>
                Ocelots are nocturnal, resting in the trees/dense brush during the day, and traveling up to 5 miles per night. As opportunistic hunters, their diet consists of a range of animals (rodents, rabbits, snakes, lizards, fish). <br>

            <h2>Northern Sea Otter</h2>
            <p>The Northern Sea Otter (enhydra lutris kenyoni) is a subspecies of sea otters (enhydra lutris) and listed as endangered. They can be found in the Aleutian Islands, Southern Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington, preferring shallow waters with sandy or rocky bottoms. The sea otters rarely come onto shore, and if they do, they remain close to the water. Sea otters are the largest member of the weasel family, with dense underfur (brown to black color) and longer guard hairs (brown to black to silver). To aid in swimming, their back feet are webbed and their front feet are short and stiff. Their average length is 5 ft, and their diet consists of crabs, sea urchins, mussels, clams, fish, octopus, and other marine invertebrates.<br>

            <h2>Alabama Red-Bellied Turtle</h2>
            <p>The first animal to be discussed this month is the Alabama red-bellied turtle (pseudemys alabamensis) and are listed as endangered. These turtles are about 1 foot long, with the female upper shell being slightly larger than the males. The upper shell comes in a multitude of colors, including green to darkish brown, black with yellow/orange/red vertical markings along the side, which are usually more intense in the younger turtles. The head, neck, and legs have yellowish striping, and the males have elongated fore claws. At the tip on their upper jaw, they have a notch, with a tooth-like cusp on each side. <br>
            These turtles are typically found in shallow vegetated backwaters of freshwater streams, rivers, bays, and bayous in/adjacent to Mobile Bay. As their feeding habits means feeding on submergent aquatic macrophytes, they prefer being in areas that have soft bottoms and extensive beds that hold those macrophytes. <br>

            <h2>WELCOME!</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my blog on endangered animals! About once a month, I will be posting about an endangered animal. I’m going to be trying to talk about animals from all over the world, not just animals located in a specific area. <br>
            The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 that stopped the loss of plant and animal life. It’s unique in that there is no cost-benefit analysis before going into action. But why should you care? Why should species be protected? Well, the loss of a plant or animal can affect everyone. There are ecological, aesthetic/recreational, and medical importance of protecting all species. <br>
            A healthy ecosystem depends on not losing species, as one loss of species will in turn trigger the loss of another species, and so on. Ecosystems help purify our environment. If an ecosystem is lost, we, as humans, will not have clean air, water, or land, which in turn affects our health. A lot of people are also dependent on ecosystems for their job/industry. Millions of people visit and participate in wildlife activities. Preserving the ecosystem will allow future people to continue to visit and keep their jobs. <br>
            Medicine used was also originally obtained from plants or some other natural product. However, not all plant species have been tested for medicinal purposes, and thousands more that have yet to be identified. If a plant life is lost, we may lose a cure to a future disease. <br>
